    "## Web Scraping\n",
    "Web Scraping is the extraction of data from a website, and in this case, the Python library called **Beautiful Soup** will be used. The scraper loads the HTML code of the page the user wants to collect data from, then the scraper will either extract all the data on the page or the user will go through the process of selecting the specific data they want from the page. That is done by looking at the website’s HTML code and selecting the the specific element or tag that the desired information is in. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data to Scrape\n",
    "In this practical we will look at how to do web scraping on imdb.com to fetch information about movies with different genres using Python BeautifulSoup and requests. IMDB (Internet Movie Database) website is owned by Amazon, is one of the best platforms for finding information about films, television shows, web series, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data that we want to extract from it are:\n",
    "* Movie title\n",
    "* Release date\n",
    "* Genre\n",
    "* Movie length\n",
    "* Movie certification\n",
    "* Rating\n",
    "* Metascore\n",
    "* Description\n",
    "* Votes\n",
    "\n",
    "To extract all of this data, our scrapper will need to go inside each film’s webpage. Now let's start scrapping."
